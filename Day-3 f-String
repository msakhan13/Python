# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
# 1 Year = 365 days
# 1 Year = 52 Weeks
# 1 Year = 12 Months

age = input("What is your current age? ")

days = (90*365) - (int(age)*365)
weeks = (90*52) - (int(age)*52)
months = (90*12) - (int(age)*12)
print (f"You have {days} days, {weeks} weeks, and {months} months left.")
